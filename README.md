**Linear Regression with Python**

**Business Problem** 

Your neighbor is a real estate agent and wants some help predicting housing prices for regions in the USA. It would be great if you could somehow create a model for her that allows her to put in a few features of a house and returns back an estimate of what the house would sell for.

She has asked you if you could help her out with your new data science skills. You decide to use Linear Regression to predict the price of houses in USA.

**The data contains the following columns:**

'MedInc': Median Income of residents of the city house is located in
